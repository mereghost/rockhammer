The idea of this slow moving project is to provide a really fast rubygems server.
(Note: and to learn how Rubygems & Bundler really work)

The feature list should include:

- Proxy to Rubygems.org
- S3 backend
- Nifty UI
- Blazing fast search (both for rubygems and UI)
- Some admin interface to keep things clean.
- Maybe some user data.
