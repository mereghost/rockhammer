###Index Generation:

1.  `gem generate_index` => generate the index for the provided directory.
2.  Need to check how to do it when the real deal is on s3.
    + Read the implementation of generate_index in search of the necessary wisdom
    - It grabs the specs from the .gem using Gem::Package.new(.gem).spec (from rubygems/package)
    - The rubygems indexer acts on a list of simplified specs (probably for size and mem consumption reasons
    - The simplified (abbreviated) version removes the /(?:test_)?files/, cert_chain and rdoc informations
    - It does some sanitization for the specs, mainly the strings for author names and what not.
    - The index is then generated by Marshaling an **Array** of _[gem name, gem version, gem platform]_
    - There's an index for prerelease, released and latest (only the current versions of all gems)
    - For the quick index, the takes gemspec adds the .rz and Marshal dumps a deflated version of it on the /quick/ subdir
        + Not sure of it's use yet
